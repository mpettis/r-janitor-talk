# r-janitor-talk
Short talk on R janitor package, and data workflows.

This is a Rpres presentation, with supporting markdown reports and R scripts that talk about using the `janitor` package
to systematically deal with column header standardization when reading in from other sources.

It also discusses a standardized workflow for reading data from CSV files.

You can view the presentation this way (currently not working, may be too big, but may work in future.
May be best to just download/clone and open.)
